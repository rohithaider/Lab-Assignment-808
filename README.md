# 🔐 Write-up Task-1: File Encryption and Decryption Using Symmetric AES-256 with PBKDF2

For this assignment, I performed symmetric encryption and decryption on a text file using the **AES-256 algorithm** with secure key derivation (`-pbkdf2`).

---

## 📝 Step 1: Creating the Text File

I opened a terminal and created a text file named `70012.txt` using the command:

```bash
nano 70012.txt
```
Inside this file, I typed my full name, then saved and exited by pressing Ctrl + O, Enter, and Ctrl + X.

## 🔐 Step 2: Encrypting the File

To encrypt the file using AES-256 with a secure password-based key derivation function, I ran the following command:

```bash
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -pbkdf2 -in 70012.txt -out encrypted_70012.txt -pass pass:70012
```
+ pbkdf2 ensures a stronger key derivation method.

+ salt adds randomness for added security.

+ pass pass:70012 uses my roll number as the password.

This command created an encrypted file called encrypted_70012.txt.

## 🔓 Step 3: Decrypting the File
To verify the encryption, I decrypted the file back to its original form with:

```bash
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -pbkdf2 -in encrypted_70012.txt -out decrypted_70012.txt -pass pass:70012
```
This produced the file decrypted_70012.txt, containing the original content.

# 🔐 Write-up Task-2: RSA Key Pair Generation and File Encryption/Decryption Using OpenSSL

In this part of the assignment, I performed asymmetric encryption using RSA public-private key pairs.


## 🔑 Step 1: Generating the Private Key
I created a 2048-bit RSA private key using the command:

```bash
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private_70012.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
```

## 📤 Step 2: Generating the Public Key
After the private key was created, I extracted the corresponding public key by running:

```bash
openssl rsa -pubout -in private_70012.pem -out public_70012.pem
```

## 🔐 Step 3: Encrypting the File Using the Public Key
With both keys ready, I encrypted 70012.txt using the public key:

```bash
openssl pkeyutl -encrypt -pubin -inkey public_70012.pem -in 70012.txt -out encrypted_rsa_70012.txt
```
I verified that the encrypted file encrypted_rsa_70012.txt was successfully created by listing the files in my directory.

## 🔓 Step 4: Decrypting the File Using the Private Key
To ensure the encryption worked, I decrypted the file with the private key:

```bash
openssl pkeyutl -decrypt -inkey private_70012.pem -in encrypted_rsa_70012.txt -out decrypted_rsa_70012.txt
```
After decryption, I confirmed the file decrypted_rsa_70012.txt existed and matched the original content.

## 🧾 Final Step: Verifying Content
I opened both the encrypted and decrypted files using a text editor (nano) to inspect their contents and ensure everything worked as expected.
